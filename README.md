# ReproStories
A location to hold potential RerpNim How would you solve simple things ideas and drafts. Perhaps they will graduate into the official ReproNim How Would document...

Story ideas are initiated as 'issues'. In the issue, the submitter can point to another document (google doc) or discuss the story in the issue.
The goal is to develop a sharable story that may be useful (directly, or by example) for the community.
